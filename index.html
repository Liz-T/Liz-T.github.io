	<h1>Fragmented Network</h1>
	<p>I have a desire to capture things, one way or another.</p>
  <p>It's always interesting. It's mostly fun. At times it's exhausting.</p>
  <p>I log, in a variety of ways, images, thoughts and ideas. Both those I make and those I find.</p>
	<p>Fragmented network is an attempt to gather together, organise and hopefully provide some relief for my brain. </p>
	<p>Here you'll find links to things such as:</p>
	<ul>
    <li>projects; finished, in progress or not started</li>
    <li>'notes'; text, images or sound captured in sketchbooks, on recording devises or with cameras</li>
    <li>ideas and thoughts on a variety of things I have created, or read or listen to</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Fragments</h1>
<p>An inconsistent attempt to document all the things, a <a href="Project diary.html" target="_blank">log</a> more than a diary</p>

	<h3>A way to explore the newtork by location</h3>
	<p>Various 'locations', methods, I use to capture things. Both web and non web</p>
